## Question 1
(K&R Exercise 5-13) Write the program <code>tail</code>, which prints the last n lines of its input. By default, n is 10, let us say, but it can be changed by an optional argument, so that

<code>    tail -n</code>

prints the last n lines. The program should behave rationally no matter how unreasonable the input or the value of n. Write the program so it makes the best use of available storage; lines should be stored as in the sorting program of Seciton 5.6, not in a two-dimensional array of fixed size.

Compile Steps: 
gcc q2.c
Output:
